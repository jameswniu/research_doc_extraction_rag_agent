Privacy concerns paradoxically prevent engagement, with participants expressing discomfort about sharing information required for the removal process itself. Lack of perceived value dominates responses, with multiple participants using definitive language like 'never' and 'absolutely neither.' This group requires fundamental value proposition education before any conversion becomes viable, or may represent permanently unqualified prospects.",
