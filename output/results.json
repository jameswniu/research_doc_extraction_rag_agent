Nearly half of positive-leaning responses immediately pivot to price concerns, treating always-on VPN as table stakes rather than a differentiator. Phrases like 'depends on cost,' 'if affordable,' and 'what's the price' dominate, signaling that the value proposition lands but conversion hinges entirely on pricing strategy. For CLIENT, this segment represents low-hanging fruit if bundled or competitively priced, but premium positioning will stall adoption.",
