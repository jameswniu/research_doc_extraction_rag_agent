#### Privacy and Security Protection Drives Strong Appeal (46%)

Security concerns dominate this segment's interest in private server locations, with identity protection ranking as the top priority. Strong preference exists for features that mask personal location and prevent hacking, particularly when using public Wi-Fi or conducting financial activities.

#### Feature Rejected as Unnecessary or Counterproductive (17%)

Strong resistance appears toward private server locations, with participants viewing the feature as a gimmick or security liability. Concerns about traceability and maintenance requirements outweigh perceived benefits by a ratio of 2:1 in this segment. Several participants prefer servers in different countries specifically to maximize anonymity, making personal locations counterintuitive to their VPN usage goals. Skepticism about VPN reliability and fears of identity exposure through predictable location patterns reinforce rejection. This segment prioritizes simplicity and traditional VPN functionality, suggesting marketing should avoid emphasizing this feature to avoid alienating privacy purists.

**Quotes:**

> "Not appealing Maintenance, traceability"
