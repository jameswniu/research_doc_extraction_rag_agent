# Thematic Analysis

---

## 1. What factors influenced your choice of VPN provider?
*Participants Involved: 105*

## Security dominates VPN provider selection criteria

Security and privacy drive 49% of VPN choices, with ease/support at 14%, price at 12%, speed/reliability at 12% and access/geo-unlocking at 12%. Prioritize and clearly communicate superior security and privacy features, then tier plans around support quality and performance rather than discount-led pricing.

**Security and Privacy Above All (49%)**

*Participants Involved: 51*

No-logs policies, encryption strength, and hacker protection dominate the decision calculus. Participants repeatedly cite fear of data theft, tracking, and identity compromise as primary motivators-words like 'safe,' 'secure,' and 'protect' appear in nearly every response within this cluster. The emotional undertone is defensive: these aren't power users seeking features, they're everyday consumers seeking peace of mind. For product positioning, leading with trust signals and zero-knowledge architecture will resonate far more than technical specs.

> "I really wanted to protect my identity without having my information stolen. To protect my identity. No logs policy" - P4444

> "Security and privacy How strong the VPN's encryption is, what security protocols it uses, and if it has a strict no-logs policy" - P4742

> "Protects me by encrypting data and masking my IP addresses, hiding my browsing activity, identity, and location, and allowing for greater privacy and autonomy." - P4543

**Ease and Support Seal the Deal (14%)**

*Participants Involved: 15*

'Just make it work.' Setup friction and poor support kill adoption for this segment. They prioritize intuitive interfaces, cross-device compatibility, and responsive customer service over technical depth. Several mention relying on recommendations or bundled solutions because independent evaluation feels overwhelming. For providers, reducing onboarding complexity and offering 24/7 support aren't nice-to-haves-they're table stakes for capturing less technical buyers.

> "Something very easy to use/open up, something with a good user reviews. If they offer you support should there be a breach, that would be awesome." - P4535

> "Customer support If the VPN has an intuitive and user-friendly app that is easy to set up and use, and if the provider offers 24/7 customer support" - P4765

> "It came with my phone. Security." - P4451

**Price Drives the Decision (12%)**

*Participants Involved: 13*

Cost sensitivity trumps feature depth for this segment. 'Cheap,' 'free,' and 'low-priced' surface repeatedly, with several participants explicitly using free trials or free-tier products despite acknowledging security needs. Value-for-money framing-not premium positioning-will capture this price-conscious cohort. Bundling strategies or freemium models represent the clearest path to conversion here.

> "I need low priced services" - P4532

> "Just the basics. I found something free online. It works, so I keep using it. no, nothing that involved or thorough." - P4553

> "privacy cost convenience cheap and affordable" - P4846

**Speed and Reliability Non-Negotiable (12%)**

*Participants Involved: 13*

Performance anxiety runs high. Participants fear that security will come at the cost of usability-slow connections, dropped servers, laggy browsing. They want protection that doesn't punish them with friction. 'Fast,' 'reliable,' and 'speed' anchor their criteria, often paired with concerns about server stability. Marketing that emphasizes 'protection without compromise' and benchmarks connection speeds will outperform generic security messaging.

> "Fast speeds and a reliable connection are the two most important features I look for when choosing a VPN." - P4826

> "When choosing a VPN, the most important features/capabilities that I consider are the speed, locations that I can pick from, and how reliable the servers are. Thank you! Have a fantastic day. Take care and stay healthy! :)" - P4549

> "A vpn that has high Internet speed" - P4728

**Access and Geo-Unlocking Primary (12%)**

*Participants Involved: 13*

Unlike the security-first crowd, these participants treat VPNs as access tools, not shields. Streaming foreign Netflix libraries, bypassing regional restrictions, and accessing work assets while traveling define their use cases. Server location variety matters more than encryption protocols. Product messaging should highlight global server coverage and content unblocking-security becomes a secondary benefit, not the headline.

> "If I can browse other country's netflix" - P4741

> "Able to access my local media while out of the country as I travel. I also use public wifi and my VPN is my protection." - P4555

> "what and where I can access different countries streaming" - P4457

## 2. How important is hiding your location when using a VPN?
*Participants Involved: 106*

## Location masking is secondary to real protection

Hiding location is not a primary driver, with 36% viewing it as security theater and 32% seeing no personal relevance, while only 21% value access flexibility and 11% seek autonomy. Prioritize concrete security outcomes and education in messaging, positioning location masking as a supporting benefit rather than the core value.

**Security Theater Over Location Masking (36%)**

*Participants Involved: 38*

Protection from hackers and data theft dominates the conversation-location hiding is just a means to that end. Nearly every response in this segment frames location features through a security lens: preventing hacking, protecting identity, keeping financial data safe. The actual geographic masking matters far less than the psychological comfort of feeling protected. For product positioning, lead with security outcomes rather than technical location-spoofing capabilities.

> "Yes I like being able to set to set my own location as I don’t want my location compromised. I don’t want my home exposed as there could be potential dangers associated with it." - P4453

> "It’s very appealing because it’s effect and worth the cost The benefits is that I can be able to surf the internet without my identity revealed" - P4460

> "I LOVE THIS FROM MY HOUSE. I CAN LOG ON AND OFF EVERYDAY KNOWING I AM SAFE. NO DRAWBACKS. BENEFITS KNOWING I HAVE SECURITY AND AN EXTRA WALL OF PROTETION." - P4510

**Skeptics See No Personal Relevance (32%)**

*Participants Involved: 34*

"Not something I personally need." A substantial segment dismisses location features as irrelevant to their use case-often home-only users or those who see VPNs as single-purpose tools. Many express confusion about the feature's value or view it as complexity without benefit. Technical unfamiliarity compounds disinterest; several admit they don't understand how it works. Conversion requires education-first marketing that connects location features to scenarios these participants actually encounter.

> "Not very. To me, that is a gimmick. Maybe nice for a gamer, but that is not what I use it for. Drawback is that everyone has to have the same VPN provider." - P4435

> "I probably wouldn't use it because i only use my VPN when I need a secure connection. I don't really understand what the uses would be." - P4519

> "I don't need a private server so it's not really appealing to me. I don't know enough about it to offer an opinion." - P4532

**Flexibility and Access Drive Appeal (21%)**

*Participants Involved: 22*

'I can use it anywhere I choose.' Convenience and multi-location access trump pure privacy for this segment. Participants emphasize the ability to work remotely, access content from different regions, and maintain connectivity across devices and locations. The VPN becomes a utility for lifestyle flexibility rather than a fortress against threats. Messaging should highlight seamless access and location optionality as productivity enablers.

> "This feature is quite appealing to me because it ensures I can utilize distinctive features of the vpn from the comfort of my home or any other location of my choosing. Ease of use is paramount. It ensures security and ease of use as well as assuring a smooth transition from various endpoints or locations of my choosing." - P4479

> "I like this feature as it ensures that I can use the vpn service anywhere I choose It ensures that I have a lot of options when it comes to locations and endpoints and that is valuable to me" - P4485

> "Well, with private locations I’d be able to watch different shows on Netflix with no y location seemingly being in. Different country or state There’s no draw backs in my eyes" - P4830

**Control Seekers Want Personal Autonomy (11%)**

*Participants Involved: 12*

Unlike the security-first crowd, these participants frame location features as personal sovereignty over their digital footprint. Responses center on 'control,' 'managing,' and 'choosing'-the ability to dictate terms rather than simply defend against threats. They want to decide what information flows where, treating the VPN as an extension of personal agency. Product framing should emphasize user empowerment and customization over passive protection.

> "I really like this feature because it feels like I have control over what comes my way when I use the internet. I like to mask myself to different regions as to make sure no trackers know my physical location, so I don't get tracked." - P4816

> "Obviously, it's very appealing. People want privacy, despite living in a world where it's been dwindling for decades, Sorry, I don't understand the question. I don't perceive any disadvantages, only advantages." - P4553

> "I think this is a good feature as people Don t know where you are I would not use a personal location I would be somewhere else" - P4468

## 3. How appealing is a VPN that is always available?
*Participants Involved: 106*

## Always-on VPN draws strong but uneven interest

A total of 57% of participants are curious or ready to switch to an always-available VPN, while 21% are disengaged and 22% are either price-gated or satisfied and skeptical. Prioritize converting the 34% curious segment with low-friction trials and clear always-on value messaging.

**Curious But Non-Committal (34%)**

*Participants Involved: 36*

Open to learning more, but no urgency to act. These participants offer lukewarm responses-'would research it,' 'might look into it,' 'open to options'-without expressing clear enthusiasm or rejection. They lack both the pain points that drive eager adopters and the brand loyalty that anchors satisfied participants. Education-heavy marketing and low-commitment entry points like free trials could convert this persuadable middle, but they won't respond to urgency-based messaging.

> "There hasn’t been a time it has done that I would be quite curious to see what it has to offer. I’m open to new and better things" - P4485

> "I have not really had any problems. I would possibly try it if I could find a benefit from switching." - P4484

> "Nothing comes to mind I would research the product" - P4525

**Eager Adopters Ready to Switch (23%)**

*Participants Involved: 24*

'I would be excited.' 'That would be awesome.' Enthusiasm runs high among participants who've experienced connection drops, site blocking, or slowdowns with current VPNs. Pain points like Reddit blocking VPN users or surveys rejecting VPN connections create real friction that an always-available solution directly addresses. This segment represents the lowest-hanging fruit-they've articulated the problem and are actively seeking alternatives, making them ideal early adopters for targeted acquisition campaigns.

> "Reddit has begun blocking you if you use a VPN. I would love it" - P4435

> "Sometimes the websites I'm using, like market research surveys, won't allow me to complete surveys if I'm on a VPN. It would be great!" - P4458

> "Sometimes that VPN service drops which is quite frustrating. I do find it bothersome though. I would be delighted and would want to try their service." - P4735

**Disengaged or No Clear Need (21%)**

*Participants Involved: 22*

No problem means no purchase intent. Flat responses like 'Meh,' 'Not a priority,' and 'None' signal participants who either don't use VPNs actively or see no gap in their current setup. Several explicitly state satisfaction with their ISP or existing security bundle, suggesting privacy protection isn't top-of-mind. This segment falls outside the addressable market for standalone VPN offerings but could be reached through bundled security suites where VPN is an add-on rather than the hero feature.

> "No Meh" - P4434

> "None Not a priority." - P4451

> "No, no disappointment I would only be interested if they were bundled with my security service" - P4461

**Interested But Price-Gated (11%)**

*Participants Involved: 12*

Cost is the unlock, not the feature itself. Nearly half of all participants express genuine interest in always-on VPN protection but immediately pivot to pricing concerns-'what's the cost,' 'if affordable,' 'depends on price.' Current satisfaction with existing solutions creates low switching urgency, meaning competitive pricing becomes the primary lever for conversion. For market entry, freemium trials or aggressive bundling will outperform feature-led messaging with this segment.

> "No, I have not, at least not so far. Since I've not had any issues with Bitdefender's VPN, I think the cost of this service would be my primary concern." - P4466

> "I’m not sure That would be great if affordable" - P4531

> "No, I cannot. Again, ithas served me well every time I've used it. If it's free, and unlimited, I'll definitely make the switch." - P4553

**Satisfied and Skeptical of Change (11%)**

*Participants Involved: 12*

Loyalty to current providers runs deep here. Responses like 'I trust it completely' and 'wouldn't be swayed' reveal participants who've built relationships with existing VPN brands over years. No compelling pain point exists to disrupt inertia-their current solutions work well enough. Winning this segment requires either a catastrophic competitor failure or a dramatically differentiated value proposition beyond 'always available,' which they perceive as table stakes.

> "Will block some sites I want to visit. I have been with this current site for several years now and trust it completely." - P4470

> "No. I haven't had any issues or problems whatsoever. I probably wouldn't pay much attention because I have that now." - P4471

> "No, I haven't had significant reliability issues. Accessibility is usually very good. I wouldn't be surprised or impressed much, I would assume most VPNs can do that." - P4711

## 4. What features do you wish your VPN offered?
*Participants Involved: 88*

## Most participants lack clear unmet VPN feature demands

70% of participants are either satisfied or disengaged, with the remaining 30% split across speed (12%), security transparency (9%), mobile usability (5%), and price (3%). Prioritize differentiated performance and security-transparency features, then educate participants to convert passive satisfaction into active preference.

**Satisfied or Simply Disengaged (70%)**

*Participants Involved: 62*

"Nothing comes to mind" dominates this dataset-a mix of genuine satisfaction and low product engagement that's difficult to distinguish. Nearly three-quarters of participants offered no feature requests, suggesting either adequate service delivery or, more likely, limited understanding of what VPNs could offer. For product teams, this represents both validation and risk: satisfied customers don't churn, but disengaged ones don't advocate or expand usage.

> "Nothing comes to mind. The service meets my expectations." - P4532

> "No,have everything I need." - P4467

> "It’s the capabilities I don’t know about that interests me if that makes sense" - P4570

**Speed and Server Performance Gaps (12%)**

*Participants Involved: 11*

"Speed!" isn't a nice-to-have-it's the primary functional complaint among dissatisfied participants. Slow connections and limited server options create real friction, with participants explicitly linking performance to usability across multiple geographic locations. This cluster reveals that reliability and speed remain table-stakes expectations that some providers still fail to meet, creating clear competitive vulnerability for underperforming brands.

> "Multiple locations with very fast connections. I need options that are equally viable" - P4479

> "it is a bit slow and like i mentioned earlier it is very lacking in servers in other countries so those two it increased the speed a it but like i also said the speed isn't the most important thing i am willing to give up speed for quality you know in safety and you know so it its speed is important but it's also lower on my list of and things i want but definitely wanting more servers that something i would like" - P4808

> "speed!" - P4473

**Security Assurance and Transparency Needs (9%)**

*Participants Involved: 8*

Beyond basic encryption, a segment craves visibility and confirmation that protection is actually working. Requests range from breach alerts to live IP location displays-signals that "trust but verify" applies to privacy tools themselves. One participant even requested a personal rep to build relationship-based trust. Providers could differentiate by surfacing real-time security status rather than assuming users trust invisible protection.

> "I don’t want anything too complicated but it would be nice to have some way to know if my connection or security has been compromised" - P4724

> "Showing an estimated live location of the IP I'm using" - P4709

> "I wish they. Kind of assigned you a personal rep.So that you can develop some sort of relationship with them" - P4491

**Mobile and Cross-Device Friction (5%)**

*Participants Involved: 4*

"It's pretty cumbersome to use on my phone currently." Seamless mobile experience emerges as a distinct unmet need, separate from raw performance concerns. Participants want VPN protection that travels with them without requiring technical gymnastics or degraded functionality. As mobile becomes the primary computing surface, providers failing the phone experience risk losing relevance entirely.

> "The ability to use it seamlessly on my phone. it is pretty cumbersome t use on my phone currently." - P4735

> "VPN for me to use on my phone." - P4535

> "That it travels with me on my phone everywhere I go" - P4814

**Price Sensitivity Persists (3%)**

*Participants Involved: 3*

"Cheaper cost or free app" surfaces despite VPNs being relatively low-cost subscriptions. Price-conscious participants want bundled value or reduced rates, suggesting that standalone VPN pricing faces pressure from free alternatives and security suites. For go-to-market strategy, bundling with broader privacy offerings may neutralize price objections while increasing perceived value.

> "Cheaper cost or free app" - P4832

> "The service could be bundled with more cybersecurity features. They could feature lower prices as well." - P4711

> "I think it is positive and affordable at this way, maybe I could try another features to improve performance." - P4481

## 5. What motivated you to remove your personal data online?
*Participants Involved: 60*

## Control, not crisis, drives data removal

Participants primarily acted to proactively control their digital footprint (38%), followed by reacting to security breaches (25%), escaping surveillance and spam (20%), and alleviating generalized exposure anxiety (17%). Prioritize messaging and features that emphasize proactive control and visibility over data trails, rather than solely breach-driven fear.

**Proactive Control Over Digital Footprint (38%)**

*Participants Involved: 23*

'I want less information about me available to the public.' Unprompted by any breach, these participants pursue data minimization as a lifestyle choice. They manually clear cookies, refuse third-party tracking, and methodically reduce their online presence-not from fear, but from principle. Satisfaction levels run higher here because expectations are calibrated to effort, not outcomes. Product messaging should emphasize ongoing control and transparency rather than crisis response.

> "I want less information about me available to the public yes and no - not sure how "deleted" it really is" - P4473

> "I want the least amount of my information out in the world, which includes not being on any social media sites. It is hit or miss. Even though I try, I am not always successful." - P4543

> "I don't like my information to be available and I don't like being tracked I don't know if it really helps or how much information is being erased" - P4477

**Security Breaches Forced Their Hand (25%)**

*Participants Involved: 15*

Direct victimization-hacking, fraud, stolen credit cards-pushed these participants to act. Nearly half reference specific incidents: compromised accounts, unauthorized purchases, data appearing on the dark web. The emotional residue is palpable; even after taking action, many remain skeptical that their data is truly gone. For providers, this segment represents reactive buyers who convert post-incident but carry deep trust deficits that require ongoing proof of efficacy.

> "My credit card was used and I don't know who used it to purchase stuff online Yes" - P4514

> "used an internet data cleansing service after emails stolen it searched and erased my stolen data including on the dark web" - P4528

> "My credit card was stolen but in my wallet The thieves used the number on my card but my card was in my wallet I had just gotten off the credit card site after paying my monthly bill then not 10 minutes later someone stole the number and used it to try to buy 500 dollars sneakers Very satisfied" - P4566

**Escaping Surveillance and Spam Overload (20%)**

*Participants Involved: 12*

Tracking fatigue drives this cohort-cookies, targeted ads, spam emails, and the creeping sense of being watched. One participant captured it plainly: 'I knew the sites I visited were being tracked.' Unlike breach victims, their pain is chronic annoyance rather than acute crisis. Satisfaction correlates directly with reduced contact from unwanted sources. Positioning data deletion as spam elimination and ad-blocking resonates more than security framing for this segment.

> "I knew the sites I visited were being tracked and cookies put on my computer It worked somewhat. It does happen again, though." - P4457

> "The things that lead me to make the decision to delete my personal data from websites/online databases are to have more privacy and fewer spam texts, emails, and/or calls. You are welcome! I will tell you that I was very satisfied with the process of deleting my data and the results obtained." - P4549

> "For more privacy, I dont like how easy it is for people to be able to look up my name and find information on me like, where I live, etc. Im very satisfied, its more affective then I thought." - P4843

**Generalized Anxiety About Modern Exposure (17%)**

*Participants Involved: 10*

Media coverage of data breaches and documentaries have seeded ambient dread. 'It's a pretty scary world that we're living in'-these participants can't point to a specific incident but feel viscerally unsafe. Their actions are preventive and often vague: locking social media, changing passwords, hoping for the best. Conversion requires education over fear-mongering; they need clarity on what protection actually looks like, not amplification of existing anxiety.

> "i want to let of shows on on tv as far as netflix and stuff like that with data breaches and all kinds of stuff so i mean it's a it's a pretty scary world that we're living in and the best protection is keep the vpn in place so that secure my my granddaughter secure and the rest of my family is secure because i mean god forbid if anything should happened with and unsecured computer system i was pretty satisfied i i take off everything if i'm not using it just to protect us i said i'm that's one of my major concerns so i i take the time out to do it and it doesn't really bother me as long as i feel safe and secure" - P4480

> "I think it is a great step to be careful about our privacy and comfort. I feel happy about it so I don't have any concern at this point." - P4481

> "The ability to secure and make sure my data is safe Very satisfied" - P4460

## 6. Would you consider removing your personal information from data broker sites?
*Participants Involved: 30*

## Strong intent to delete, but resistance pockets remain

40% of participants show clear intent to remove their data, 33% firmly reject the idea, 20% are cost and effort sensitive, and 7% are weak maybes. Prioritize a low-friction, clearly priced core offering while segmenting messaging to convert the cost-sensitive group and deprioritize hard rejectors.

**Clear Interest, Ready to Act (40%)**

*Participants Involved: 12*

'Yes if it's not necessary'-even the awkwardly phrased responses point the same direction: these participants see value and signal readiness. Security concerns drive some ('people hacking information online is common place'), while others simply recognize the benefit without elaboration. This segment represents the warmest leads in the funnel, requiring minimal persuasion and maximum ease of conversion. Product teams should treat this cohort as early adopter candidates for beta programs or premium tiers.

> "I will certainly consider this because because people hacking information online is common place" - P4516

> "Yes, it will be beneficial." - P4735

> "Yes, I would be interested. But, I participate in many online communities and survey sites, so I'm concerned removing this information might affect that participation." - P4466

**Firm Rejection, Low Persuadability (33%)**

*Participants Involved: 10*

Unlike the cost-sensitive middle, this segment has already decided-and the answer is no. Responses range from terse ('never', 'lack of interest') to trust-based objections ('I would have to give out information I am not comfortable doing'). The trust objection is particularly telling: some view data deletion services as just another data collection vector. Conversion here requires fundamental repositioning or may simply not be worth the acquisition cost.

> "no.. I would have to give out information I am not comfortable doing" - P4490

> "never" - P4790

> "lack of interest" - P4781

**Interest Gated by Cost and Effort (20%)**

*Participants Involved: 6*

Price and convenience are the twin gatekeepers to adoption. Nearly half of conditionally interested participants explicitly cite cost, steps required, or both as decision factors-revealing that the value proposition lands but the friction equation remains unsolved. Responses like 'it depends on the costs and convenience' and 'I don't know how to do it and not sure how much it would cost' signal that education and transparent pricing could convert this fence-sitting segment. Strategic implication: a low-friction, clearly-priced entry point could unlock significant latent demand.

> "It would depend on the cost and the steps required to remove my personal information." - P4559

> "Maybe but I don't know how to do it and not sure how much it would cost." - P4519

> "it depends on the costs and convenience" - P4505

**Noncommittal Maybes, Weak Signal (7%)**

*Participants Involved: 2*

A 'maybe' with no elaboration offers almost nothing to work with. Two participants gave single-word conditional responses that reveal neither objection nor enthusiasm-they're not rejecting the concept, but they're not engaging with it either. This thin signal suggests low category awareness or low personal relevance. Marketing efforts here should focus on problem awareness before solution selling.

> "Maybe" - P4458
