## 1. What factors influenced your decision when choosing your VPN?
*Participants Involved: 105*

## Privacy Dominates VPN Selection Decisions

Privacy and anonymity drive 39% of VPN choices, followed by usability and trust at 26%, speed and server access at 23%, and price and value at 11%. Prioritize privacy-centric features and transparent trust practices in product and marketing to win and retain high-intent participants.

**Privacy and Anonymity Above All (39%)**

*Participants Involved: 41*

No-logs policies, identity protection, and anti-tracking dominate the decision calculus here. Participants repeatedly cite hiding browsing activity, masking IP addresses, and escaping surveillance-whether from hackers, advertisers, or governments. Nearly every response in this cluster mentions some form of 'protection' or 'privacy' as the primary driver, with encryption and anonymity features serving as table stakes. For brands, this segment demands transparency on data handling and will scrutinize privacy policies before price.

> "I really wanted to protect my identity without having my information stolen. To protect my identity. No logs policy" - P4444

> "Protects me by encrypting data and masking my IP addresses, hiding my browsing activity, identity, and location, and allowing for greater privacy and autonomy." - P4543

> "Security and privacy How strong the VPN's encryption is, what security protocols it uses, and if it has a strict no-logs policy" - P4742

**Usability and Trust Reduce Friction (26%)**

*Participants Involved: 27*

Ease of use, cross-device compatibility, and customer support emerge as the gatekeepers to adoption. Participants describe wanting intuitive interfaces, seamless setup, and responsive help when things go wrong. Recommendations from security services or employers carry weight, signaling that trust proxies matter when technical knowledge is low. Brands that simplify onboarding and offer visible support channels will convert this segment faster than those leading with feature lists.

> "Something very easy to use/open up, something with a good user reviews. If they offer you support should there be a breach, that would be awesome." - P4535

> "Customer support If the VPN has an intuitive and user-friendly app that is easy to set up and use, and if the provider offers 24/7 customer support" - P4765

> "i thin ease of use and reliability are both key" - P4829

**Speed and Server Access Drive Choice (23%)**

*Participants Involved: 24*

Performance trumps privacy rhetoric for this cohort. Fast connections, reliable servers, and broad geographic coverage appear as the deciding factors-participants want to stream region-locked content, access work assets, or simply avoid lag. Location selection and network quality rank above security features in their hierarchy. This segment will tolerate modest privacy trade-offs for a seamless, buffer-free experience, making speed benchmarks and server counts critical marketing proof points.

> "When choosing a VPN, the most important features/capabilities that I consider are the speed, locations that I can pick from, and how reliable the servers are. Thank you! Have a fantastic day. Take care and stay healthy! :)" - P4549

> "Fast speeds and a reliable connection are the two most important features I look for when choosing a VPN." - P4826

> "fast cheap and convenient I like a VPN which is fast in connection and efficient" - P4736

**Price and Value Seal the Deal (11%)**

*Participants Involved: 12*

Cost sensitivity overrides feature depth. 'Free,' 'cheap,' and 'low-priced' surface repeatedly, with participants explicitly weighing security benefits against subscription fees. Several settled for free options that 'just work' rather than investing in premium alternatives. Brand reputation and reviews serve as risk-reduction proxies when budgets are tight. Freemium models and transparent pricing will capture this segment; premium-only positioning loses them at the gate.

> "It is free and it won't spy on me" - P4520

> "Just the basics. I found something free online. It works, so I keep using it. no, nothing that involved or thorough." - P4553

> "privacy cost convenience cheap and affordable" - P4846

## 2. How important is having a private server location to you?
*Participants Involved: 106*

## Privacy control is a powerful but polarizing driver

33% of participants are strongly motivated by privacy control, while 30% are skeptical, 24% prioritize practical utility, and 12% are cautiously interested but underinformed. Prioritize a clear, business-focused value proposition for private server locations and pair it with simple education to convert skeptics and the cautious segment.

**Privacy Control Drives Strong Appeal (33%)**

*Participants Involved: 35*

Location masking isn't optional-it's the core value proposition. These participants connect private server locations directly to identity protection, with responses consistently linking the feature to hiding physical whereabouts from potential threats. Nearly all express genuine enthusiasm, citing benefits like preventing doxxing, protecting home addresses, and maintaining anonymity while browsing. For this segment, private server locations transform VPNs from generic security tools into personal safety infrastructure.

> "Yes I like being able to set to set my own location as I don’t want my location compromised. I don’t want my home exposed as there could be potential dangers associated with it." - P4453

> "It well allow me to go undetected my location Benefits are I don't have to share a server or location point" - P4457

> "I really like this feature because it feels like I have control over what comes my way when I use the internet. I like to mask myself to different regions as to make sure no trackers know my physical location, so I don't get tracked." - P4816

**Skeptics See Complexity, Not Value (30%)**

*Participants Involved: 32*

Feature fatigue is real-these participants dismiss private server locations as unnecessary complexity or outright gimmicks. Responses reveal a mix of confusion about the feature's purpose, satisfaction with current setups, and active resistance to perceived over-engineering. Several explicitly state they lack the technical knowledge to benefit, while others question whether it adds meaningful security. Marketing must overcome the 'solution looking for a problem' perception before conversion becomes possible.

> "Not very. To me, that is a gimmick. Maybe nice for a gamer, but that is not what I use it for. Drawback is that everyone has to have the same VPN provider." - P4435

> "Not sure. I don’t know much about it. What are the benefits. Not much for me. If I was doing something shady maybe." - P4451

> "It's slightly interesting, but seems to be too complex and like it would be a hassle to use. I'm not sure how it would impact my privacy and security, so that uncertainty is a drawback." - P4711

**Practical Utility Over Privacy Theater (24%)**

*Participants Involved: 25*

'I can finish my work as soon as possible'-functionality beats philosophy here. These participants evaluate private server locations through a lens of accessibility, convenience, and real-world application rather than abstract security benefits. They appreciate being able to work remotely, access content across regions, and maintain consistent connections. The strategic read: position this feature around productivity and flexibility, not just protection.

> "Yes I can access the VPN from anywhere and it will be available on the any devices. So I can finish my work as soon as possible Benefits about VPN Access and Privacy Protection for the Public Domain Users via Privacy to the extent that they can access it without having access to the data" - P4446

> "This feature is quite appealing to me because it ensures I can utilize distinctive features of the vpn from the comfort of my home or any other location of my choosing. Ease of use is paramount. It ensures security and ease of use as well as assuring a smooth transition from various endpoints or locations of my choosing." - P4479

> "Very, especially for offsite backups I just want an easy way to have an offsite backup for a 3-2-1 backup strategy" - P4550

**Cautiously Interested, Needs Education (12%)**

*Participants Involved: 13*

Curiosity without commitment defines this segment. They find the concept 'interesting' or 'appealing' but hedge with uncertainty about how it works, what it costs, or whether it fits their needs. Unlike outright skeptics, these participants remain open-they just need the knowledge gap closed. Responses frequently include phrases like 'would need to learn more' and 'not sure how it would impact me.' A targeted education campaign could convert this fence-sitting group into advocates.

> "It's somewhat appealing because I use my VPN at home a lot. I would need to look into this more As far as benefits go, I would imagine it would provide more protection. As far as drawbacks go, me not having enough information is about it" - P4516

> "It sounds appealing but I would need to learn more about how it works or how much extra it will cost me It would give me a better sense of privacy but may result in a higher bill from my service provider" - P4520

> "that that sounds like something interesting oh sorry car just passed by that does sound interesting i think i'd be willing to look into something like that and to learn more about how that would be useful to me yeah that that does sound appealing to me i think that could be useful maybe easier to something more private that you wouldn't wanna send on the open air be easier to make sure that only the people you wanna see you want to see get to see it i think that's probably the main benefit and there's probably that'd be good obviously if you were in like a different state and they have different restrictions or obviously a country i don't need to i shouldn't have even mentioned that though that's the main draw of vpn in the first place" - P4808

## 3. Would you be interested in a VPN that better meets your needs?
*Participants Involved: 106*

## Nearly Half Are Actively Open To Better VPNs

48% of participants are exploring better options, while 20% are satisfied, 13% are price-sensitive, 11% are frustrated by drops, and 8% are driven by blocked sites. Prioritize a premium, reliability-focused tier with transparent pricing to convert explorers and price-gated participants.

**Open Explorers Seeking Information (48%)**

*Participants Involved: 51*

No major complaints, yet genuine curiosity drives engagement. 'I would be curious and want to look into it' captures the stance-these participants aren't fleeing problems but are receptive to better options if educated properly. They ask about features, performance specifics, and differentiation rather than price. Content marketing and comparison tools will convert this segment; they want to understand before committing. Low urgency but high persuadability with the right information architecture.

> "There hasn’t been a time it has done that I would be quite curious to see what it has to offer. I’m open to new and better things" - P4485

> "No specific instance comes to mind I would be curious and want to look into it" - P4520

> "NordVPN has always met my expectations, but I am looking for a service that FAR surpasses my expectations and surprises me with how good it is I would be very excited and interested about such an alternative service!" - P4812

**Satisfied and Unmotivated to Switch (20%)**

*Participants Involved: 21*

'I probably wouldn't pay much attention because I have that now.' Contentment breeds inertia. This substantial segment reports zero issues with current VPNs and responds to the new offering with polite disinterest or outright dismissal. Loyalty isn't passionate-it's habitual. They'll only consider alternatives if their current provider fails or if bundling with existing security services creates convenience. Acquisition costs here are high; retention-focused competitors should note these are their most vulnerable customers to poach only through disruption.

> "No. I haven't had any issues or problems whatsoever. I probably wouldn't pay much attention because I have that now." - P4471

> "Not applicable Would avoid and continue using mine" - P4460

> "No, no disappointment I would only be interested if they were bundled with my security service" - P4461

**Curious But Price-Gated (13%)**

*Participants Involved: 14*

Interest exists, but the wallet decides. Nearly half of all responses express openness to exploring a new VPN while immediately pivoting to cost concerns-'at what cost to me?' echoes throughout. Current satisfaction runs high enough that switching requires a compelling value proposition, not just feature parity. The strategic play here is trial-based acquisition with transparent pricing; these participants won't leap without seeing the invoice first.

> "I never had a problem I would want to know what the price is" - P4457

> "not so far at least sure, at what cost to me?" - P4732

> "No, I cannot. Again, ithas served me well every time I've used it. If it's free, and unlimited, I'll definitely make the switch." - P4553

**Connection Drops Drive Frustration (11%)**

*Participants Involved: 12*

Reliability failures-disconnects, slowdowns, registration lag-dominate the complaint pattern here. 'Connection dropping' and 'slow at times' surface repeatedly, revealing a segment that's technically engaged enough to notice performance gaps but not loyal enough to tolerate them. These participants express genuine enthusiasm for alternatives ('That would be awesome,' 'I would be excited'), signaling low switching costs once a stability promise lands. Speed and uptime claims will outperform security messaging.

> "Sometimes that VPN service drops which is quite frustrating. I do find it bothersome though. I would be delighted and would want to try their service." - P4735

> "Sometimes need to restart computer to be able to access it. Disconnects on it's own sometimes and won't reconnect That would be excellent" - P4749

> "connection dropping it will be better. it will catch my interest" - P4763

**Blocked Sites Fuel Switching Intent (8%)**

*Participants Involved: 8*

'Reddit has begun blocking you if you use a VPN. I would love it.' Site-blocking frustrations create the clearest purchase trigger in this dataset. These participants have hit walls-streaming services, survey platforms, retail sites-and the pain is specific and memorable. Unlike the passively satisfied, they've experienced concrete failure moments that prime them for alternatives promising better access. Messaging that leads with 'unblock everything' will resonate immediately.

> "Reddit has begun blocking you if you use a VPN. I would love it" - P4435

> "Sometimes the websites I'm using, like market research surveys, won't allow me to complete surveys if I'm on a VPN. It would be great!" - P4458

> "I can't access Home Depot in my home town U.S. from Panama. As my family lives in my home town, it makes it hard to order gifts, etc. from this group. I also can't access Lowe's. That would be nice but I'd have to review it. I like that Surfshark is pretty inexpensive." - P4555

## 4. Is there anything you wish your VPN offered?
*Participants Involved: 88*

## Most participants see no unmet VPN needs

69% of participants report full satisfaction, while 31% want better security, transparency, speed, reliability, mobile experience, and server coverage. Prioritize a premium security-and-performance tier that explicitly markets stronger protection, transparent practices, and guaranteed speeds to convert the 31% into higher-value subscribers.

**Satisfied, Nothing Comes to Mind (69%)**

*Participants Involved: 61*

"Can't think of anything" dominates this dataset-a passive contentment that signals low engagement rather than true satisfaction. Nearly three-quarters of responses deflect the question entirely with variations of "no," "none," or "not sure," revealing participants who either lack the product literacy to articulate needs or simply haven't encountered friction severe enough to spark feature demands. For product teams, this silence is dangerous: it masks latent needs that competitors could surface first.

> "Nothing comes to mind. The service meets my expectations." - P4532

> "There are not any capabilities/features that I wish my current VPN service provider offered that it doesn't today." - P4549

> "It’s the capabilities I don’t know about that interests me if that makes sense" - P4570

**Enhanced Security and Transparency (12%)**

*Participants Involved: 11*

Beyond baseline encryption, these participants want proof their VPN actually works-live IP location displays, breach notifications, and bundled cybersecurity tools. One participant's request for a "personal rep" underscores a deeper trust deficit: they're paying for protection but can't verify they're getting it. Providers who surface real-time security status and offer human touchpoints will capture this trust-hungry segment.

> "I don’t want anything too complicated but it would be nice to have some way to know if my connection or security has been compromised" - P4724

> "Showing an estimated live location of the IP I'm using" - P4709

> "I wish they. Kind of assigned you a personal rep.So that you can develop some sort of relationship with them" - P4491

**Speed and Reliability Are Non-Negotiable (10%)**

*Participants Involved: 9*

Performance anxiety runs through this segment-speed isn't a nice-to-have, it's the primary pain point. Participants explicitly call out slow servers, unreliable connections, and the need for "equally viable" location options, suggesting current offerings force trade-offs between speed and geography. The business read: VPN providers competing on security features alone will lose these participants to whoever solves the latency problem first.

> "Multiple locations with very fast connections. I need options that are equally viable" - P4479

> "speed!" - P4473

> "it is a bit slow and like i mentioned earlier it is very lacking in servers in other countries so those two it increased the speed a it but like i also said the speed isn't the most important thing i am willing to give up speed for quality you know in safety and you know so it its speed is important but it's also lower on my list of and things i want but definitely wanting more servers that something i would like" - P4808

**Seamless Mobile Experience Wanted (5%)**

*Participants Involved: 4*

"Cumbersome" and "travels with me" surface a clear mobile gap-participants expect VPN protection to extend effortlessly to phones, but current implementations fall short. The friction isn't about missing features; it's about clunky execution on mobile devices that breaks the always-on security promise. This segment represents a retention risk as mobile-first competitors enter the market with native-feeling apps.

> "The ability to use it seamlessly on my phone. it is pretty cumbersome t use on my phone currently." - P4735

> "VPN for me to use on my phone." - P4535

> "That it travels with me on my phone everywhere I go" - P4814

**Expand Server Locations and Access (3%)**

*Participants Involved: 3*

Geographic coverage gaps frustrate this cohort more than any technical limitation. Requests for "more options in terms of countries" and servers that work "for every website without limitation" reveal participants hitting geo-restriction walls regularly. Unlike the speed-focused segment, these participants prioritize breadth of access over raw performance-they'll tolerate slower connections if it means reaching blocked content.

> "I wish it offered more options in terms of countries I could connect to." - P4453

> "Working for every website without limitation." - P4458

> "Access to more secured servers" - P4728

## 5. How satisfied were you with the steps you took to remove your data?
*Participants Involved: 60*

## Data deletion confidence remains dangerously fragile

Only 20% of participants were fully satisfied, while 37% were skeptical data was actually deleted, 28% were satisfied but found the process painful, and 15% felt overwhelmed by systemic vulnerability. Standardize a transparent, verifiable deletion workflow with clear proof-of-removal to convert skeptics and reduce friction.

**Skeptical Data Actually Disappeared (37%)**

*Participants Involved: 22*

'Not sure how deleted it really is.' Doubt dominates this segment-participants completed removal steps but harbor deep uncertainty about whether anything actually changed. They describe data reappearing on the same sites within days, feeling like information is 'still out there,' and lacking any verification that erasure occurred. Nearly all express a gap between action taken and confidence in outcome. This trust deficit represents a critical failure point: without proof of deletion, the entire value proposition collapses.

> "ID theft tears ago Meh. Most providers don't seem to do enough. They appear to remove data, but it shows right back up on the same sites within days of being removed." - P4435

> "I want less information about me available to the public yes and no - not sure how "deleted" it really is" - P4473

> "I don't like my information to be available and I don't like being tracked I don't know if it really helps or how much information is being erased" - P4477

**Satisfied but Process Was Painful (28%)**

*Participants Involved: 17*

Relief came eventually, but the journey frustrated. Participants here achieved their data removal goals yet describe the experience as cumbersome, difficult, or requiring manual effort that felt excessive. They got results-locked accounts, deleted information, changed passwords-but the friction left a mark. For product teams, this signals opportunity: satisfaction with outcomes masks dissatisfaction with process, and competitors offering smoother workflows could easily poach these hard-won converts.

> "I have done manually to ensure credit cards are not stored and passwords are different y. No. It’s cumbersome." - P4451

> "Bots making fake identities and using your profile picture and info It was kind of hard but eventually was able to be done. I was not pleased that it would not be immediate when deleted" - P4814

> "I felt it was a good idea. You can't be too careful these days. I am very pleased. I deleted stuff online and I monitor to see if anything else pops up." - P4471

**Fully Satisfied, No Reservations (20%)**

*Participants Involved: 12*

Uncomplicated wins exist. A smaller cohort reports straightforward satisfaction-steps worked, anxiety lifted, no lingering concerns. These participants tend toward brevity ('Very satisfied,' 'Yes,' 'so far, so good'), suggesting the process met expectations without drama. What separates them from skeptics isn't necessarily different tools but different threat profiles: many cite specific resolved incidents rather than ambient privacy anxiety. They represent the baseline experience companies should aim to replicate at scale.

> "Because I don't want nobody knowing my identity. I felt relieved doing that." - P4444

> "The ability to secure and make sure my data is safe Very satisfied" - P4460

> "When they shared my info with other sites without my knowledge or permission. completely satisfied" - P4470

**Overwhelmed by Systemic Vulnerability (15%)**

*Participants Involved: 9*

Fear outpaces action here. Participants express existential dread about data security-describing a 'scary world,' feeling watched, and sensing that breaches are inevitable regardless of personal effort. Their responses trail off mid-sentence or spiral into broader anxieties about corporate negligence and identity theft. Satisfaction with specific steps barely registers because the problem feels unsolvable. Marketing reassurance won't land; these participants need education and agency, not promises.

> "i want to let of shows on on tv as far as netflix and stuff like that with data breaches and all kinds of stuff so i mean it's a it's a pretty scary world that we're living in and the best protection is keep the vpn in place so that secure my my granddaughter secure and the rest of my family is secure because i mean god forbid if anything should happened with and unsecured computer system i was pretty satisfied i i take off everything if i'm not using it just to protect us i said i'm that's one of my major concerns so i i take the time out to do it and it doesn't really bother me as long as i feel safe and secure" - P4480

> "well it just seems that there's it you it's it's scary easy it is for people to get access to your data it's especially scary because companies there's literally es sorry another car is passing there's a little box on a lot of websites that you can check do not sell sell my data they're just selling your diet for five dollars you know that's we anybody can just pay them five dollars and have everything that company has on you it's it's scary so i started taking measures to make sure that that won't happen to me you know you can get your you get your account hacked you could but that's like on the lower end you could have your high identity stolen you could get ddos swat it's really it's it's scary nowadays well obviously it's is no real way to tell how much has already gotten out and what companies have what its some companies make it very difficult like discord for instance you had to specifically send an email to them from an to a specific obscure email within thirty days of making your account or you would never be able to say no to it it's it it's sc and it's scary and i i a luckily i managed to do that and i hope that i did good i hope that i removed a lot of my data i hope that i've made it more difficult for anybody who wants it to get it i so i don't know am i satisfied though i don't know good like i said i have no idea how much is already out there i hope i'm satisfied i hope i did a good job but no way to know" - P4808

> "Being hacked Just ok still not totally secure" - P4449

## 6. Would you consider removing your personal information from data broker sites?
*Participants Involved: 30*

## Most participants want help to opt out

47% of participants say yes but need clear removal guidance, while 27% refuse, 13% are disengaged, 10% are price and effort sensitive, and 3% are driven by security fears. Build a guided, low-friction opt out experience with transparent pricing to convert the largest segment.

**Yes, But Show Me How (47%)**

*Participants Involved: 14*

Interest exists but execution knowledge is missing. These participants express clear willingness to remove their data, yet consistently flag uncertainty about process, cost, and practical steps. The gap between intent and action represents a conversion opportunity for services that simplify the removal process with transparent pricing.

> "Maybe but I don't know how to do it and not sure how much it would cost." - P4519

> "This would interest me, I just don't know how to go about it" - P4816

> "Yes, I would be interested. But, I participate in many online communities and survey sites, so I'm concerned removing this information might affect that participation." - P4466

**Hard No, Door Closed (27%)**

*Participants Involved: 8*

Flat rejection with zero openings for persuasion. Some cite distrust of the removal process itself, others express complete disinterest-but the outcome is identical. Marketing spend here yields nothing; these participants have opted out of the conversation entirely.

> "no.. I would have to give out information I am not comfortable doing" - P4490

> "never" - P4790

> "lack of interest" - P4781

**Noncommittal and Disengaged (13%)**

*Participants Involved: 4*

'Maybe' with no elaboration signals low salience, not active resistance. These participants haven't rejected the concept-they simply haven't engaged with it meaningfully. Without a triggering event or compelling narrative, they'll remain passive indefinitely.

> "Maybe" - P4458

> "Not at the moment" - P4750

> "Absolutely neither" - P4513

**Price and Effort Gate Everything (10%)**

*Participants Involved: 3*

Cost-benefit calculus dominates decision-making here. Nearly every response in this cluster conditions interest on affordability and convenience-they're persuadable but won't tolerate friction. Positioning removal services as low-effort and competitively priced could unlock this fence-sitting segment.

> "it depends on the costs and convenience" - P4505

> "It would depend on the cost and the steps required to remove my personal information." - P4559

> "Possibly depending if it costs more" - P4491

**Security Fear Drives Urgency (3%)**

*Participants Involved: 1*

'Hacking is commonplace' reveals the emotional trigger that separates active interest from passive curiosity. Unlike the cost-conscious segment, this participant prioritizes protection over price. Fear-based messaging around breach risks would resonate strongly here.

> "I will certainly consider this because because people hacking information online is common place" - P4516
