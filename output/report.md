## 1. What factors influenced your choice of VPN provider?
*Participants Involved: 105*

## Privacy-first criteria dominate VPN selection

Participants chose VPNs primarily for privacy and security (53%), followed by speed and reliability (19%), price and ease of use (17%), and geo-access needs (10%). Prioritize and clearly message superior privacy protections while maintaining competitive performance and simple onboarding.

**Privacy and Security Above All (53%)**

*Participants Involved: 56*

No-logs policies, encryption, and hacker protection dominate the decision calculus. Responses repeatedly emphasize identity masking, data encryption, and freedom from tracking-with several explicitly naming no-logs as a dealbreaker. Nearly half of all participants anchor their VPN choice in some form of security or privacy assurance, signaling that trust-based messaging and transparency around data handling will resonate strongest with this segment.

> "I really wanted to protect my identity without having my information stolen. To protect my identity. No logs policy" - P4444

> "Security and privacy How strong the VPN's encryption is, what security protocols it uses, and if it has a strict no-logs policy" - P4742

> "Protects me by encrypting data and masking my IP addresses, hiding my browsing activity, identity, and location, and allowing for greater privacy and autonomy." - P4543

**Speed and Reliability Win Daily Use (19%)**

*Participants Involved: 20*

Fast connections and stable performance outweigh feature depth for this cohort. Participants describe needing VPNs that 'just work'-reliable servers, minimal latency, and consistent uptime. For CLIENT, this signals that performance benchmarks and uptime guarantees should feature prominently in competitive positioning, especially against bloated multi-feature competitors.

> "Fast speeds and a reliable connection are the two most important features I look for when choosing a VPN." - P4826

> "Fast and strong network" - P4514

> "When choosing a VPN, the most important features/capabilities that I consider are the speed, locations that I can pick from, and how reliable the servers are. Thank you! Have a fantastic day. Take care and stay healthy! :)" - P4549

**Price and Ease Decide the Rest (17%)**

*Participants Involved: 18*

'Free' and 'cheap' appear alongside 'easy to use' as the deciding factors for budget-conscious or low-involvement participants. Several landed on their current VPN simply because it was bundled, free, or required zero setup. For CLIENT, this segment represents a conversion challenge-freemium tiers or seamless onboarding may be necessary to compete for their attention.

> "Just the basics. I found something free online. It works, so I keep using it. no, nothing that involved or thorough." - P4553

> "I need low priced services" - P4532

> "It has to be a free trial or something equal" - P4807

**Geo-Access Drives Adoption (10%)**

*Participants Involved: 11*

Streaming libraries and region-locked content are the gateway drug. Participants explicitly cite accessing foreign Netflix, local media while traveling, and bypassing geo-restrictions as primary motivators. This use case offers a clear acquisition hook-leading with entertainment access before layering in security benefits could lower the barrier to trial.

> "If I can browse other country's netflix" - P4741

> "Able to access my local media while out of the country as I travel. I also use public wifi and my VPN is my protection." - P4555

> "what and where I can access different countries streaming" - P4457

## 2. How appealing is having a private server location with your VPN?
*Participants Involved: 106*

## Private VPN servers strongly attract privacy-focused

Having a private server location is highly appealing, with 48% of participants driven by privacy control, while 25% find it irrelevant, 21% see tradeoffs and risks, and 6% want more information. Prioritize a premium private-server tier targeted at privacy-maximizing participants, paired with clear education to convert skeptics and the curious segment.

**Privacy Control Drives Strong Appeal (48%)**

*Participants Involved: 51*

Location masking and personal control over data emerge as the primary value drivers. Participants repeatedly cite hiding their home location, preventing tracking, and maintaining anonymity as core benefits-'I don't want my home exposed as there could be potential dangers associated with it.' Nearly half express genuine enthusiasm for this feature, connecting it directly to safety concerns and the ability to browse without identity exposure. For CLIENT, this segment validates positioning private server locations as a security-first feature rather than a technical add-on.

> "Yes I like being able to set to set my own location as I don’t want my location compromised. I don’t want my home exposed as there could be potential dangers associated with it." - P4453

> "It’s very appealing because it’s effect and worth the cost The benefits is that I can be able to surf the internet without my identity revealed" - P4460

> "I really like this feature because it feels like I have control over what comes my way when I use the internet. I like to mask myself to different regions as to make sure no trackers know my physical location, so I don't get tracked." - P4816

**Feature Irrelevance for Basic Users (25%)**

*Participants Involved: 27*

'I don't see the need for this'-a consistent refrain from participants whose VPN usage stays narrow and home-bound. These individuals lack technical sophistication or simply don't travel enough to see value in location flexibility. Several explicitly state they only use VPNs at home or don't understand the feature's purpose, revealing a knowledge gap rather than active rejection. CLIENT faces an education challenge here: these participants aren't opposed, they're uninformed about use cases that might resonate.

> "I probably wouldn't use it because i only use my VPN when I need a secure connection. I don't really understand what the uses would be." - P4519

> "I don't need a private server so it's not really appealing to me. I don't know enough about it to offer an opinion." - P4532

> "This feature would be of no interest to me. I only use my home site. I'm not knowldgeable enough to offer an opinion." - P4561

**Skeptics See Tradeoffs and Risks (21%)**

*Participants Involved: 22*

Security concerns cut both ways for this segment. While acknowledging potential benefits, these participants immediately surface drawbacks: hackers noticing patterns, doxxing risks, slower speeds, and reliability failures. One notes 'hackers may notice a pattern' while another worries the feature 'doesn't really give the privacy it's meant to provide.' This group applies critical thinking to marketing claims and won't convert without transparent communication about limitations. Messaging that acknowledges tradeoffs while demonstrating mitigation will resonate more than pure benefit claims.

> "It is appealing because I don't want to get hacked. The benefits are you know where it is, and the drawbacks are hackers may notice a pattern." - P4496

> "that's cool, It doesn't really gives the privacy that it's meant to provide" - P4728

> "The closer the server is to me increases the likelihood of better speeds and optimal performance. It can reduce internet speed and increase latency, which slows down my online activities. Using it can also get my accounts blocked by websites for suspicious activity." - P4543

**Curious But Need More Information (6%)**

*Participants Involved: 6*

'It sounds appealing but I would need to learn more'-fence-sitters who express interest without commitment. Unlike outright skeptics, these participants show openness but lack sufficient understanding to form strong opinions. Cost uncertainty and feature complexity create hesitation rather than rejection. Roughly one in eight fall here, representing a persuadable segment that could convert with clearer product education and transparent pricing. Low-friction trials or explainer content could move this group toward adoption.

> "It sounds appealing but I would need to learn more about how it works or how much extra it will cost me It would give me a better sense of privacy but may result in a higher bill from my service provider" - P4520

> "that that sounds like something interesting oh sorry car just passed by that does sound interesting i think i'd be willing to look into something like that and to learn more about how that would be useful to me yeah that that does sound appealing to me i think that could be useful maybe easier to something more private that you wouldn't wanna send on the open air be easier to make sure that only the people you wanna see you want to see get to see it i think that's probably the main benefit and there's probably that'd be good obviously if you were in like a different state and they have different restrictions or obviously a country i don't need to i shouldn't have even mentioned that though that's the main draw of vpn in the first place" - P4808

> "it would be convenient but it is not a deal breaker to me it could be convenient" - P4473

## 3. How appealing is a VPN that is always available?
*Participants Involved: 106*

## Always-on VPN draws interest but needs education

A majority 52% of participants are curious but need education, while 19% are driven by pain points, 16% are loyal to incumbents, and 13% are interested but constrained by price. Prioritize clear education on benefits and differentiated value, then layer targeted pricing to convert the interested and price-gated segments.

**Curious Explorers Need Education (52%)**

*Participants Involved: 55*

'Tell me more' is the refrain-interest exists but understanding doesn't. Responses like 'would research the product,' 'want to look into it,' and 'eager to know what it's about' reveal a segment that's open but uninformed. Several explicitly ask for comparisons to current solutions or admit technical concepts are 'over my head.' For CLIENT, this represents a content marketing opportunity: clear, jargon-free education on always-on VPN benefits could convert fence-sitters who lack the knowledge to self-select.

> "Some of the things in the way they describe them are kind of over my head.I don't always understand it I would absolutely try it" - P4491

> "Been great so far no issues WOW Tell me more I would look into another alternative VPN Service" - P4566

> "There hasn’t been a time it has done that I would be quite curious to see what it has to offer. I’m open to new and better things" - P4485

**Pain Points Create Openings (19%)**

*Participants Involved: 20*

Connection drops, site blocking, and slowness are pushing participants toward alternatives. Frustrations like 'Reddit blocks you if you use a VPN,' 'disconnected while making use of it,' and 'failed to load and was slow' reveal concrete pain points that an always-available VPN directly addresses. These participants respond with enthusiasm-'would be awesome,' 'would love it,' 'delighted'-because the pitch solves their lived experience. This is CLIENT's highest-intent segment: messaging should lead with reliability and site-access guarantees.

> "Reddit has begun blocking you if you use a VPN. I would love it" - P4435

> "Sometimes that VPN service drops which is quite frustrating. I do find it bothersome though. I would be delighted and would want to try their service." - P4735

> "Sometimes the websites I'm using, like market research surveys, won't allow me to complete surveys if I'm on a VPN. It would be great!" - P4458

**Satisfied Incumbents Won't Switch (16%)**

*Participants Involved: 17*

Loyalty to current providers creates a high switching barrier. These participants explicitly state satisfaction with existing VPNs and express minimal interest in alternatives-'I trust it completely,' 'works well enough,' and 'wouldn't be swayed' signal deep entrenchment. Several mention years-long relationships with current providers, indicating that reliability track records matter more than feature promises. CLIENT faces an uphill battle here; displacement requires either a catastrophic competitor failure or a bundling play that removes friction entirely.

> "Will block some sites I want to visit. I have been with this current site for several years now and trust it completely." - P4470

> "No. I haven't had any issues or problems whatsoever. I probably wouldn't pay much attention because I have that now." - P4471

> "Not applicable Would avoid and continue using mine" - P4460

**Interested But Price-Gated (13%)**

*Participants Involved: 14*

Cost is the unlock-not the feature itself. Nearly half of positive-leaning responses immediately pivot to price concerns, treating always-on VPN as table stakes rather than a differentiator. Phrases like 'depends on cost,' 'if affordable,' and 'what's the price' dominate, signaling that the value proposition lands but conversion hinges entirely on pricing strategy. For CLIENT, this segment represents low-hanging fruit if bundled or competitively priced, but premium positioning will stall adoption.

> "I never had a problem I would want to know what the price is" - P4457

> "I’m not sure That would be great if affordable" - P4531

> "not so far at least sure, at what cost to me?" - P4732

## 4. What features do you wish your VPN offered?
*Participants Involved: 88*

## VPN feature set already meets most expectations

68% of participants report no unmet VPN needs, while 32% highlight gaps in speed and reliability (10%), security and transparency (9%), access and flexibility (7%), and price-service value (6%). Prioritize a premium tier that guarantees faster, more reliable connections with auditable security and clear value-based pricing.

**Satisfied, No Unmet Needs (68%)**

*Participants Involved: 60*

"It has all features" captures the dominant sentiment-most participants simply cannot articulate missing capabilities because their current VPN meets expectations. Responses cluster around variations of "nothing comes to mind" and "I'm satisfied," suggesting either genuine contentment or low engagement with advanced functionality. Strategically, this signals a ceiling on feature-driven upsell potential; differentiation must come from bundling, pricing, or trust-building rather than capability expansion.

> "No,have everything I need." - P4467

> "Nothing comes to mind. The service meets my expectations." - P4532

> "It has all features" - P4763

**Speed and Reliability Frustrations (10%)**

*Participants Involved: 9*

"Speed!" isn't a feature request-it's a pain point. Participants here explicitly call out slow connections, unreliable performance, and server bottlenecks as their primary friction. Words like "faster," "higher speeds," and "speeding up server time" recur, often paired with frustration about inconsistent experiences across locations. For CLIENT, this validates that performance benchmarks and infrastructure investment are table-stakes differentiators in a crowded market.

> "speed!" - P4473

> "Multiple locations with very fast connections. I need options that are equally viable" - P4479

> "it is a bit slow and like i mentioned earlier it is very lacking in servers in other countries so those two it increased the speed a it but like i also said the speed isn't the most important thing i am willing to give up speed for quality you know in safety and you know so it its speed is important but it's also lower on my list of and things i want but definitely wanting more servers that something i would like" - P4808

**Enhanced Security and Transparency (9%)**

*Participants Involved: 8*

"Just more secure" sounds vague, but dig deeper and a pattern emerges: participants want reassurance, not just protection. Requests range from breach notifications to visible IP location displays to bundled cybersecurity features. One participant explicitly wants "some way to know if my connection has been compromised." This segment craves transparency and proactive communication-trust signals that go beyond backend encryption claims.

> "I don’t want anything too complicated but it would be nice to have some way to know if my connection or security has been compromised" - P4724

> "Showing an estimated live location of the IP I'm using" - P4709

> "The service could be bundled with more cybersecurity features. They could feature lower prices as well." - P4711

**Expanded Access and Flexibility (7%)**

*Participants Involved: 6*

Unlike the speed crowd, these participants prioritize geographic reach and cross-platform usability over raw performance. Requests for "more countries," "working for every website," and seamless mobile functionality reveal a use case centered on content access and device flexibility. Two participants specifically flag mobile experience as "cumbersome"-a clear product gap. Addressing multi-device friction and server diversity could unlock adoption among this access-driven segment.

> "I wish it offered more options in terms of countries I could connect to." - P4453

> "Working for every website without limitation." - P4458

> "The ability to use it seamlessly on my phone. it is pretty cumbersome t use on my phone currently." - P4735

**Price and Service Relationship (6%)**

*Participants Involved: 5*

Cost sensitivity surfaces alongside an unexpected desire: human connection. One participant wishes for "a personal rep" to build a relationship with, while others bluntly request "cheaper rates" or "free." Nearly all in this cluster frame value in relational or economic terms rather than technical ones. For CLIENT, this suggests a segment where pricing transparency, loyalty programs, or concierge-style support could drive differentiation beyond feature parity.

> "I wish they. Kind of assigned you a personal rep.So that you can develop some sort of relationship with them" - P4491

> "Cheaper cost or free app" - P4832

> "Perhaps cheaper rates, faster and more reliable service, and even more accessibility to media outside my area" - P4812

## 5. What motivated you to remove your personal data online?
*Participants Involved: 60*

## Identity fears dominate data removal motivation

Participants primarily removed data due to fear of identity exploitation (30%) and proactive privacy minimalism (25%), followed by security breaches (22%), tracking and spam (13%), and platform-specific lockdown (10%). CLIENT should lead with identity theft and breach-driven messaging while bundling easy, proactive privacy tools to capture the largest motivation segments.

**Fear of Identity Exploitation (30%)**

*Participants Involved: 18*

Financial fraud and identity theft loom large-but haven't necessarily happened yet. These participants act on anxiety about what could occur: fake identities created from their data, doxxing threats, or strangers accessing personal details to open credit lines. Media coverage of data breaches and true-crime content amplifies their concern. Skepticism about whether deletion 'really works' runs high in this group, suggesting CLIENT must address verification and proof-of-removal to convert worried browsers into paying customers.

> "I don’t want my personal information to be used to open up potential lines of financial gain. Not really sure it the information was completely deleted." - P4453

> "i want to let of shows on on tv as far as netflix and stuff like that with data breaches and all kinds of stuff so i mean it's a it's a pretty scary world that we're living in and the best protection is keep the vpn in place so that secure my my granddaughter secure and the rest of my family is secure because i mean god forbid if anything should happened with and unsecured computer system i was pretty satisfied i i take off everything if i'm not using it just to protect us i said i'm that's one of my major concerns so i i take the time out to do it and it doesn't really bother me as long as i feel safe and secure" - P4480

> "Bots making fake identities and using your profile picture and info It was kind of hard but eventually was able to be done. I was not pleased that it would not be immediate when deleted" - P4814

**Proactive Privacy Minimalists (25%)**

*Participants Involved: 15*

'Just don't need all my data out there.' Unprompted by any incident, these participants pursue data minimization as a lifestyle principle-reducing digital footprint, limiting public exposure, and maintaining anonymity by default. They reference wanting to live privately, keeping information away from strangers, and systematically reducing what's available about them online. This segment represents the most aligned early adopters for CLIENT's value proposition, requiring education-light messaging focused on control and autonomy rather than fear.

> "I want the least amount of my information out in the world, which includes not being on any social media sites. It is hit or miss. Even though I try, I am not always successful." - P4543

> "I want to live a private life highly satisfied" - P4763

> "Just dont need all my data out there. its seemed to have worked." - P4746

**Security Breaches Forced Their Hand (22%)**

*Participants Involved: 13*

Hacking incidents, credit card theft, and data breaches served as the catalyst-these participants didn't act until damage was done. Nearly half reference specific security events: stolen credit cards, compromised emails, fraudulent bank activity, or company data leaks that exposed their information. The reactive nature of this segment signals opportunity for CLIENT to position data deletion as preventive insurance rather than post-breach cleanup, potentially capturing users before crisis hits.

> "used an internet data cleansing service after emails stolen it searched and erased my stolen data including on the dark web" - P4528

> "My credit card was stolen but in my wallet The thieves used the number on my card but my card was in my wallet I had just gotten off the credit card site after paying my monthly bill then not 10 minutes later someone stole the number and used it to try to buy 500 dollars sneakers Very satisfied" - P4566

> "Knowing my data was breached No" - P4749

**Tracking and Spam Drove Action (13%)**

*Participants Involved: 8*

Cookies, targeted ads, and relentless spam emails pushed these participants over the edge. The trigger wasn't catastrophic breach but cumulative annoyance-sites tracking behavior, third parties sharing data without consent, and inboxes flooded with unwanted contact. Satisfaction levels run higher here because expectations are modest: reducing noise rather than achieving total invisibility. For CLIENT, this segment validates bundling data deletion with anti-tracking features as a unified 'digital hygiene' offering.

> "I knew the sites I visited were being tracked and cookies put on my computer It worked somewhat. It does happen again, though." - P4457

> "When they shared my info with other sites without my knowledge or permission. completely satisfied" - P4470

> "The things that lead me to make the decision to delete my personal data from websites/online databases are to have more privacy and fewer spam texts, emails, and/or calls. You are welcome! I will tell you that I was very satisfied with the process of deleting my data and the results obtained." - P4549

**Platform-Specific Privacy Lockdown (10%)**

*Participants Involved: 6*

Social media is the battlefield. Rather than broad data deletion, these participants focused narrowly on locking down Facebook, making profiles friends-only, or removing themselves from specific platforms entirely. Satisfaction tends to be high because the scope is contained and success is visible. CLIENT could capture this segment by offering social media audit tools as an entry point, then upselling comprehensive data removal once trust is established.

> "I locked my Facebook page Yes. It is friends only" - P4450

> "Make my social media private Very satisfied" - P4550

> "The ability to secure and make sure my data is safe Very satisfied" - P4460

## 6. Would you consider removing your personal information from the internet?
*Participants Involved: 30*

## Strong intent, but major structural blockers

37% of participants show clear intent to remove their data, while 30% reject the idea outright, 23% are blocked by practical barriers, and 10% remain undecided. Prioritize a product that eliminates friction for the 37% ready to act and the 23% blocked by execution challenges.

**Clear Interest, Ready to Act (37%)**

*Participants Involved: 11*

'Yes if it's not necessary'-even conditional affirmatives here carry momentum. This segment expresses unambiguous interest without attaching caveats about cost or process, suggesting higher purchase readiness and lower price sensitivity. Security concerns and perceived benefit drive their openness, with one participant citing hacking as 'common place.' For go-to-market strategy, these are early adopters who can validate messaging and generate initial traction before broader market education.

> "I will certainly consider this because because people hacking information online is common place" - P4516

> "Yes, it will be beneficial." - P4735

> "I would be interested" - P4573

**Hard Rejection, No Path Forward (30%)**

*Participants Involved: 9*

'Never.' 'Lack of interest.' The finality here isn't negotiable. One-third of responses fall into outright dismissal, with some citing trust concerns-'I would have to give out information I am not comfortable doing'-that position data deletion services as paradoxically privacy-invasive. This isn't a pricing problem or awareness gap; it's fundamental category rejection. Sizing models should exclude this segment from addressable market calculations entirely.

> "no.. I would have to give out information I am not comfortable doing" - P4490

> "never" - P4790

> "lack of interest" - P4781

**Interest Blocked by Practical Barriers (23%)**

*Participants Involved: 7*

Cost and complexity stand between intent and action. Nearly half of interested participants immediately pivot to concerns about price, process difficulty, or lack of knowledge-revealing a market ready to convert if friction drops. Responses like 'I don't know how to do it' and 'depends on the cost and convenience' signal that education and transparent pricing could unlock significant demand. This segment represents the clearest product-market fit opportunity: motivated buyers waiting for an accessible solution.

> "Maybe but I don't know how to do it and not sure how much it would cost." - P4519

> "It would depend on the cost and the steps required to remove my personal information." - P4559

> "it depends on the costs and convenience" - P4505

**Fence-Sitters Lacking Conviction (10%)**

*Participants Involved: 3*

A single word-'Maybe'-captures the entire posture. Unlike barrier-focused participants who articulate specific concerns, this group offers no reasoning, no conditions, no hooks for conversion. The absence of elaboration suggests low category engagement rather than active resistance. Marketing investment here yields diminishing returns; resources better spent converting the barrier-aware segment who've already done the mental work.

> "Maybe" - P4458

> "Not at the moment" - P4750
